Here's a simpler version of the notes on the null character issue with Postgres `jsonb`:

## Null Character Issue

### Context
The Unicode character `\u0000` represents the ASCII null character. While this is a valid character in JSON, the Postgres `jsonb` data type is stricter and will reject it with an "unsupported Unicode escape sequence" error. This is because Postgres requires that all characters in the `jsonb` type be representable in the database's text encoding, and the null character cannot be.

### Why not use `json` over `jsonb`?
1. **Performance**: The `jsonb` type supports indexing and query optimization, which can significantly improve performance, especially for large JSON datasets. The `json` type does not have these capabilities.

2. **Functionality**: The `jsonb` type provides more advanced JSON manipulation functions and better data validation compared to the `json` type.

### Solution
Instead of changing the data type from `jsonb` to `json`, a simple solution is to add a middleware function to replace any null character escape sequences (`\u0000`) in the JSON data before inserting it into the `jsonb` column. This will allow you to maintain the benefits of using `jsonb` while addressing the null character issue.
