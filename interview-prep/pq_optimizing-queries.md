## Optimization Of SQL Queries

#### How Do You Approach Optimizing SQL Queries?
- Obtain the query plan in Postgres SQL to understand the execution strategy.
- Index the most commonly queried fields to reduce the latency of the read queries.
- Implement a read-write split, with separate read and write replicas, to offload the read traffic from the write traffic.
- Consider batch inserts for write-heavy workloads to improve performance.

#### Optimizations for NoSQL Databases
- **Partitioning**: Maintain a partition key that ensures an even distribution of data to avoid hotspots.
- **Replication**: Balance the number of replicas to maintain a trade-off between consistency and availability.
- **Sharding**: Divide the database into manageable shards, ensuring that shards are not isolated on a single node.

#### Use of a Denormalizer System
- If the system has heavy join-based requirements or needs to join multiple tables, consider maintaining a denormalized system where all the required data is stored in a denormalized fashion to avoid expensive joins.

The key is to approach query optimization holistically, considering the database type, workload characteristics, and specific performance requirements of the application.
