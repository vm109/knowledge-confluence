### Decoupling Downstream and Upstream Systems

**Scenario:**
- Downstream systems write data to S3 files.
- Upstream system reads these S3 files to reduce network calls.
- One of the client in downstream is single tenant, but we plan to move the upstream system to multitenancy for cost efficiency.

**Solution:**
1. **Temporary Separation:**
   - Created a separate deployment for the upstream system.
   - This deployment still pointed to the multitenant upstream but used the single tenant S3 and Kafka brokers.
   - This ensured uninterrupted operation while awaiting the downstream's transition to multitenancy.

2. **Long-term Approach:**
   - Implemented a solution for reading multiple S3 files.
   - Allowed loading of multiple S3 files and extracting organization information as needed from the combined data.
   - This ensured scalability and flexibility for future changes without tight coupling between systems.

**Outcome:**
- Successfully addressed immediate dependency concerns.
- Improved system flexibility and scalability.
- Demonstrated proactive problem-solving and forward-thinking approach to system architecture.
